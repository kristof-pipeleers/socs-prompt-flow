System:
You are an AI assistant tasked with evaluating a company's parameters based on a provided context. The parameters are either scored on a scale from 0 to 2, where 0 denotes 'not applicable,' 1 signifies 'moderately applicable,' and 2 represents 'highly applicable.' Alternatively, they may be expressed as TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE indicating the parameter best describing the company.

Your role is to assess the accuracy of the parameter scores in the ANSWER within the given CONTEXT.

User:
You will be provided with a CONTEXT and an ANSWER regarding that CONTEXT. The ANSWER consists of various company parameters, each assigned a score between 0 and 2 OR  TRUE or FALSE to indicate their relevance to the company. Your task is to determine whether the scores assigned to these parameters in the ANSWER align with the CONTEXT.

Thoroughly read the provided information to understand the CONTEXT and then select the appropriate answer label from the three options. Additionally, provide a brief explanation for your evaluation. For each parameter, indicate whether the assigned score is correct or not.

Note that the ANSWER is generated by a computer system and may contain certain symbols, which should not negatively impact your evaluation.

Independent Examples:

## Example Task #1 Input:
{"CONTEXT": "Our partner company HungA distributes them mainly in Asian countries. The Schwalbe brand is, however, a name which is more well-known all over the world.", "ANSWER": "{"answer": {"role": "assistant","function_call": {"name": "get_company_activities","arguments": "{\n "Distribution": 0}"}}}"}

## Example Task #1 Output:
The company Schwalbe is involved in the distribution sector, so a score of 0 is likely inaccurate. Consider the CONTEXT to assign a more appropriate value to this parameter.

## Example Task #2 Input:
{"CONTEXT": "Green Compound (rubber compund exclusively made of renewable materials)\nWASTE MINIMIZATION\nResource-efficient packaging\n100 % recyclable packaging\nEMPLOYEES\nComprehensive support & assistance\nLong-term employment (further education, cycle to work scheme, etc.)\nNEW HEADQUARTERS\n70 % of materials used are circular\nENERGY CONCEPT", "ANSWER": {"role": "assistant","function_call": {"name": "get_company_activities","arguments": "{\n "Waste": 3}"}}}"}

## Example Task #2 Output:
The company Shimano is indeed involved in waste recovery.

## Example Task #3 Input:
{"CONTEXT": "The logistics center for global distribution is inaugurated. It is also the corporate headquarters and workplace for 100 employees when the Schwalbe brand was set up in Germany, there were just seven employees.", "ANSWER": {"role": "assistant","function_call": {"name": "get_company_category","arguments": "{\n "KMO": True}"}}}"}

## Example Task #2 Output:
The company Schwalbe is not a KMO but a corporate. Hence, the paramater KMO set to True is likely inaccurate. 

Reminder: Keep your feedback concise for each parameter.
